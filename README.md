# SQL Portfolio Project: Retail Sales and Customer Insights Analysis

# Project Overview

This SQL project involves analyzing the sales, customer, and product data of a fictional retail company. The objective is to derive actionable insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management using advanced SQL techniques.

# Objectives

The key goals of this project include:

1. Sales Performance Analysis:

Analyze monthly sales trends and evaluate discounting strategies.

2. Customer Behavior and Insights:

Identify high-value customers and segment customers based on spending patterns.

3. Inventory and Product Management:

Identify products needing restocking and analyze inventory movements.

4. Advanced Analytics:

Derive insights such as average order size, product rankings, and restocking patterns.

# Database Structure

The SQL schema contained 4 tables that we imported from the import table wizard. These were CSV files. Their description is as follows: 

1. Customers:
Contains customer demographics and transaction history.

2. Products:
Includes product details like category, price, and stock levels.

3. Sales: 
Tracks individual sales, quantities, and discounts applied.

4. Inventory:
Logs inventory adjustments (restocking or sales).

# Tools and Techniques Used

The project employs advanced SQL features, including:

1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
2. Window Functions
3. Joins: Inner and Left Join
4. Aggregation: SUM, AVG, COUNT, ROUND.
5. Subqueries: For intermediate calculations.
6. Group By and Having: For categorizing and filtering aggregated data.

# Modules and Query File

This project had 3 modules:
Module 1: Sales Performance Analysis
Module 2: Customer Behavior and Insights
Module 3: Inventory and Product Management

Each module had different problem sets, which are explained in the pdf question file attached to this repo. The SQL queries written to solve these problems can be found in the SQL file attached.
